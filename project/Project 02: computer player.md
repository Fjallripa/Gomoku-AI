# Second project: Build a perfect TicTacToe computer player
  
## Aims of this project 
* Make `Computer` an inherited class of `Player` that has another `make_move()` method using an algorithm to determine its next move.
* Build a minmax-algorithm that only uses win and loss as a scoring function.
    + Keep in mind the need to in principle function for a variable sized board and more than two players.
* Build the basic project structures around algorithms and scoring functions.
* Adapt tests and a new game to handle the Computer player.
    + If possible, test individual parts of the algorithm and scoring function to quickly detect bugs.
    + Make at least one test demonstrating how the Computer player cannot fail at TicTacToe.
* Find a way to analyze the algorithms performance and to debug it.
    + Build basic tools for analyzing how fast the algorithm is, both in terms of time and steps.
    + Also build a basic tool for looking into how the algorithm scores different options and chooses between them.
