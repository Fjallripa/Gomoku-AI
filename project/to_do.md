# Current to do items

* Current step in project: End of objective 1. 
    [x] Player test has to be modified for the new Player.group object
    [ ] miniscore test has to be added to test behaviour with more than two players
      - Ideas:
        - begin with small tests just to check if there are no obvious bugs
        - Then the planned 6x6 multi-player test
        - Include option to choose between (1?,) 2, 3 and 4 players.
* Perform tests and debug code. (also improve Developer Mode)
  * what small tests can be done whithout entire game?
  * What does Developer Mode need for multiplayer?
  * are hints/guidelines on what to look for in Developer Mode a good idea?
  

* Developer Mode is now spread out over 2 algorithms. It should be more centralized into functions or something like that.
